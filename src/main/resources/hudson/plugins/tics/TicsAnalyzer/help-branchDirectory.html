The branch directory is the root directory of the source files for the branch. 
If this setting is provided, the branch directory will be updated prior to each TICSQServer run by invoking <code>TICSMaintenance -branchdir</code>.
Note that you can use Jenkins variables (such as <code>$WORKSPACE</code>) here.
