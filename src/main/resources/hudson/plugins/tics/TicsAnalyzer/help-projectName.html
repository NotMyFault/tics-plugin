The name of the project for which this run should be performed. This project should already exist in the TICS Configuration as you
cannot create a new project using this plugin. 
You can create a new project by using the Build Configuration page of the Viewer or by using <code>TICSMaintenance</code>
from the command line. Note that you can use Jenkins environment variables such as <code>$JOB_NAME</code> here.
