Fully qualified path to a branch. The path should be of the form <code>HIE://PROJECT/BRANCH</code>, 
where <code>PROJECT</code> should be substituted by the actual name of the project and <code>BRANCH</code> by the 
branch name for which you want to get the results. The name of the project and the name of the default branch can be 
found in the top part of the TIOBE Quality Indicator Label on the TQI Dashboard, when you select the project.
Note that you can use the variable $JOB_NAME here.
