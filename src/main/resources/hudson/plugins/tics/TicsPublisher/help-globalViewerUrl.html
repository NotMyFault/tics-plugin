<div>
URL where the TICS Viewer can be found, including the section name. Example: "http://192.168.1.1:8080/tiobeweb/TICS". 
To determine this URL, open your TICS Viewer, and copy and paste the first part of the URL from your browser's address bar here. 
<br><br>
Here you can set the URL globally for all your projects, which is useful if they all share the same TICS Viewer URL. 
You can override it in the project-specific configurations if needed.
